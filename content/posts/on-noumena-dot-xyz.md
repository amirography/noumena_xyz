Blogs tend to die extremely quickly. And I'm in no delusion of this one surviving the passage of time and my lack of motivation, at some point in the future. However, there still needs to be some pocket of internet where I can express my ever evolving thoughts. That's why I have purchased this domain: `Noumena.XYZ`

Almost every part of this domain was chosen intentionally and are in symbolic relation to the niche of this blog.

I will explain the niche part, later on. For now I have to explain the parts, `Noumena` and `XYZ`.


## Noumena {#noumena}

Let's begin with basics: Kant's concepts of `Noumena` and `Phenomena`.

Kant's philosophy can be said to be one of the most impressive and influentials philosophies. But his body of work, was let's say, not something you would read in bed. So please don't expect this short article to do justice to his ideas.

Some call some of the ideas of Kant, psychological, due to the fact of that he talks about the properties of mind. Kants psychological idea's, were, however, entirely different from current scientific endevours of modern psychology. Kant's psychology is all about what we can deduce from a the concept of mind. His statements are concerned about _every possible mind_. He was not concerned with the features of the minds of humans or animals, rather he spend a lot of time working out what the concept of mind entails. That is in contrast to modern psychology where we want to know about the features of the human mind or this or that animal's mind.

As an analogy consider these two statments. `there are n number of atoms in the universe`. and `there needs to be a universe in order to atoms to exist`. Earlier statement is something which relies on observations of people to be justified. The later statement on the other hand, cannot be concieved coherently to be wrong. Modern psychology is similar to the earlier statement, while the later resembles the psychological insights of Kant.

Now let us talk about `Noumena`. Kant asserted that things have a real nature, _things in themeselves_ or `Noumena`. Minds cannot know this true nature of things, but can merely create a symbol in mind, in order to interpret the behavior of the Noumena. That symbol doesn't need to be accurate, it just needs to be good enough to help us survive. These symbols are called _things as they appear_ or `phenomena`. Now it's important to notice that it's not our mind that Kant is concerned about, but rather, any mind (the concept of the mind, any form it takes) is the subject of interest here. So what he asserts is that we cannot, **by principle**, get access to Noumena.

Now there is one Noumena that we may have access to, and that is the Noumena that we are, because we are things by ourselves. But that's another matter that I won't go into details right now. For now, let's move on to the XYZ.


## XYZ {#xyz}

XYZ is a concept used in some thought experiment, mosly in modal logic. Which I'm not well versed in, So I hope you excuse my lack of depth here. So some relatively recent philosophers (such as Kripke... which is recent if you put right by the side of 99% of other major philosophers) believe that there are at least some identities that you cannot know a prior.
So imagine being in a world completely resembeling our world, except for one detail. That detail being that instead of \\(H\_{2}O\\) in it's see, it is filled with an extremely similar molecule which is is called **XYZ**, which locals call water. Now, if you have the complete description of \\(H\_{2}O\\), XYZ and water, without any means of examining the water is there a way to know if we live in the world with \\(H\_{2}O\\) in its seas or in the world with XYZ as its water? Some argue that even though, we can do that for example for things other than identities, we cannot do that with identities, or at least some identities. Which can cause complications in what we believe to be _necessitated_. Again details on this matter should be discuessed in a future post.


## Noumena and XYZ {#noumena-and-xyz}

Now, what to these two concepts have in common? There are many things. One is that both concepts have been exploited in philosophy of consciousness which makes up a substantial portion of my inquiries. Second, They both draw a firm and fundamental line, demonstrating the absolute limitations of ways that we can know things, without actually mystifying anything. But rather these concepts are used as an steping stone in forming our understanding of the nature of reality.
Now you might ask why Noumena and XYZ? Aren't there other concepts that I might have chosen which represent this idea better? Well... Nothing comes to my mind with a domain name available at the moment. I struggled with .com, never managing to find any good domain names. .blog was another contender, but the company behind .blog, seems to cause a lot of headache to some of its clients. So, `Noumena.XYZ` it is.
