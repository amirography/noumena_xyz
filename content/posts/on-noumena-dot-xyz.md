A blog's lifespan is often very short.  And I'm confident that this one will also succumb to time and my lack of motivation at some point in the future. Even so, my ever-evolving thoughts do need to be expressed somewhere on the internet. I have therefore purchased the following domain: `Noumena.XYZ`

All of the elements of this blog domain were deliberately chosen because of their symbolic connection to the niche. Later on, I will explain the niche part. In the meantime, I will explain what `Noumena` and `XYZ` mean.


## Noumena {#noumena}

Let's begin with basics: Kant's notions of `Noumena` and `Phenomena`.

Kant's philosophy is considered one of the most significant and influential. However, I can't imagine reading any of his work while lying in bed. Therefore, you cannot expect this short article to convey his ideas adequately.

Several of Kant's ideas have been called psychological, due to the fact that they relate to mind. Kant's psychological ideas, however, were very different from current scientific endeavors in modern psychology. Kants' psychology is focused on analyzing the concept of mind in order to draw conclusions. His statements are concerned about _every possible mind_. Rather than focusing on human or animal minds, he spent a significant amount of time studying the nature of the concept of mind. That is in contrast to modern psychology, which seeks to describe features of human minds or the minds of animals.

An analogy could be drawn from these two statements. `there are n number of atoms in the universe`. and `the existence of atoms necessitates the existence of a universe`. In order to justify the earlier statement, we are relying on people's observations. The later statement on the other hand, cannot be conceived coherently to be wrong. Modern psychology resembles the earlier statement, while the latter resembles Kant's psychological insights.

It's now time to talk about `Noumena`. Kant asserted that things have a real nature, _things in themselves_ or `Noumena`. Noumena cannot be known by the mind; it can only create a symbol in order to interpret the  behavior of things. Symbols do not have to be accurate at all; they just have to help us to survive. These symbols are called _things as they appear_ or `phenomena`. Kant's concern here isn't the mind we have, but rather any mind (the concept of a mind, regardless of its form). He maintains that we cannot, **by principle**, access Noumena.

There is one Noumena that we may be able to access, and that is the Noumena that we are, since each of us is a thing in itself. But that's a matter for another day. As of now, let's move onto XYZ.


## XYZ {#xyz}

XYZ is a concept found mainly in modal logic, which is used in some thought experiments. This is a topic I am not well versed in, so please forgive my lack of depth here. A number of fairly recent philosophers (such as Kripke, who is considered relatively recent if you compare him with most of the other major philosophers) believe that at least some identities are impossible to know _a prior_.

Think of a world that is exactly the same as ours, except for one small detail. That detail being that instead of \\(H\_{2}O\\) in its sea, it is filled with an extremely similar molecule which is called **XYZ**, which locals call water. Now, if you have the complete description of \\(H\_{2}O\\), XYZ and water, without any means of examining the water is there a way to know if we live in the world with \\(H\_{2}O\\) in its seas or in the world with XYZ as its water? Despite the fact that we can do that for things other than identities, some argue that we cannot do that with identities, or at least some identities. Which can cause complications in what we believe to be _necessitated_. Again details on this matter should be discussed in a future post.


## Noumena and XYZ {#noumena-and-xyz}

What is the common denominator between these two concepts? It is quite a few things. The first reason is that both concepts have been tapped into by philosophers of consciousness, which has formed the basis for much of my inquiry. Second, They both draw a firm and fundamental line, demonstrating the absolute limitations of ways that we can know things, without actually mystifying anything. Additionally, our understanding of reality is formed through the study of these limitations.
These limitations and the effort to use these limitations in order to draw conclusions about real-world are what fascinates me. Many of my posts-to-come, are about these kinds of limitations.

You might ask, "Why Noumena and XYZ?"? Aren't there other concepts that I might have chosen which represent this idea better? Well... Nothing comes to my mind with a domain name available at the moment. I struggled with .com, never managing to find any good domain names. .blog was another contender, but the company behind .blog, seems to cause a lot of headache to some of its clients. So, [Noumena.XYZ](https://noumena.xyz/) it is.
